[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://kadewong.github.io/files/Kade Wong CV.pdf)

I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student working in Prof. Kelly Arnold's lab at the University of Michigan. I completed my undergraduate and Master's degrees in Biomedical Engineering both at the University of Michigan, with a focus on Systems Biology. My research interests include using data-driven and ODE modeling to identify and investigate mechanisms driving heterogeneity within subpopulations in the context of infectious disease.
